# Running H264 Compression with FogROS2-SGC

### Native 
This tutorial assumes that you have followed FogROS-SGC install instructions and is able to 

#### Step 1: Install H264 Video Compression Dependency 

Install dependencies
```
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash 
sudo apt install -y libavdevice-dev libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libavutil-dev  libswscale-dev libx264-dev ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-camera-calibration-parsers
```

Install `h264_image_transport` ros packages
```
mkdir -p ~/fog_ws/src/
cd ~/fog_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/KeplerC/h264_image_transport.git
cd ~/fog_ws/
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

#### Step 2: Run encoder and decoder 

Sender Machine: 
```
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp
ros2 launch h264_image_transport launch_encoder.py
```

Receiver Machine: 
```
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp
ros2 launch h264_image_transport launch_decoder.py
```

#### Step3: Run FogROS2-SGC 

Sender Machine: 
```
SGC_CONFIG=h264_encoder.toml cargo run --release router
```

Receiver Machine: 
```
SGC_CONFIG=h264_decoder.toml cargo run router
```
(leave one side as non release for testing, if things are stable, run with release option as well)

#### Test it work
Sender Machine: 
```
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp
ros2 launch h264_image_transport launch_publisher.py
```

Receiver Machine: 
```
ros2 topic echo /image_uncompressed
```

### Containers 
#### Step 1: run encoder and decoder 
```
git clone https://github.com/KeplerC/h264_image_transport.git 
cd h264_image_transport
docker compose build && docker compose up
```

#### Step 2: Install h254 package
```
mkdir -p ~/fog_ws/src/
cd ~/fog_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/KeplerC/h264_image_transport.git
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```
TODO: need to poblish here, we only need `h264_msg` package.
we can also run fogros2-sgc as container as well.

#### Step3: Run FogROS2-SGC 

Sender Machine: 
```
SGC_CONFIG=h264_encoder.toml cargo run --release router
```

Receiver Machine: 
```
SGC_CONFIG=h264_decoder.toml cargo run router
```
(leave one side as non release for testing, if things are stable, run with release option as well)

#### Test it work
Sender Machine: 
```
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp
ros2 launch h264_image_transport launch_publisher.py
```

Receiver Machine: 
```
ros2 topic echo /image_uncompressed
```
